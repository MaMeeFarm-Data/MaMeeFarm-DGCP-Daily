## 1. Morning Observation  
**Time:** 06:35  
**Temperature:** 22°C  
**Humidity:** 95%  
**Wind:** 3 km/h  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, calm, cool morning  

---

## 2. Farm Activity  
MaMee went down early to the duck area this morning.  
The atmosphere was calm but emotionally heavy.

**Eggs collected today:** 1 egg  
**From:** one of the two surviving ducks  

The other duck is still injured and weak.  
Movement is slow, and it stays close to the corner of the enclosure.

The coop remains quiet — very different from when the flock of seven was alive.  
The silence reminds both MaMee and P’Toh of the sudden loss just two days ago.

## 3. Flock Status  
- Total remaining ducks: **2**  
- Status:
  - Duck #1 — alive, recovering, managed to lay 1 egg  
  - Duck #2 — injured, slow movement, still traumatized  

Both ducks remain fearful due to the dog attack on 13 November.

## 4. Emotional State  
- **MaMee:** sad but strong, continuing morning routine with care  
- **P’Toh:** still heartbroken, carrying the weight of the loss  
- **Atmosphere:** cold, quiet, and reflective  

The “7 Ducks of Hope” were the symbolic beginning of MaMeeFarm™.  
Losing five of them changed the energy of the farm completely.  
Every morning now feels different.

## 6. Reflection  
Even with sadness in the air, the fact that one duck still laid an egg today  
is a strong sign of resilience.

**Life continues — slowly, gently, and truthfully.**  
This is why DGCP exists: to capture the real story, day by day, without distortion.
