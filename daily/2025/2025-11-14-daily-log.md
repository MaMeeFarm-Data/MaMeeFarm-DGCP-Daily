## 1. Morning Observation  
**Time:** 08:10  
**Temperature:** 24°C  
**Weather:** Quiet, slightly cool morning  
**Flock Status:** 2 surviving ducks  
**Eggs Collected:** 1 egg  

The duck house feels unusually silent today.  
From seven lively ducks… now only two remain.  
The survivors are still frightened from yesterday’s dog attack, moving slowly and staying close together.

---

## 2. Daily Reality  
MaMee walked into the duck area carefully at 08:10.  
The remaining ducks were hesitant and alert.  
Fear still lingers from the attack on 13 November.

Despite the trauma, **one duck laid a single egg** today.  
MaMee picked it up gently — mixed feelings of gratitude and sadness.

The quietness in the coop this morning was overwhelming.

## 3. Emotional State  
**MaMee:** deeply sad, holding back tears  
**P’Toh:** heartbroken and in pain witnessing the loss  
**Atmosphere:** heavy, reflective, and slow  

From a bustling family of **7 ducks**, the house is now nearly empty.  
This change hits hard emotionally and symbolically.

The “**7 Ducks of Hope**” collection was the beginning of everything —  
the foundation of MaMeeFarm™, the spirit of the story,  
and the earliest Proof-of-Life units we ever recorded.

Their sudden absence is felt in every corner of the farm.

## 5. Reflection  
The farm is recovering — slowly.  
The ducks, the space, and the people are healing at their own pace.

This single egg today feels like a message:

**Life continues, even in sadness.**  
Proof-of-Life never lies.  
It simply records what is real — no matter how soft or painful.
